evaluation-phase1-master/data-to-text_generation/6/1904.11838v3-Stanza-out.txt	4	10	In the last few years , many different methods have been focusing on using deep recurrent neural networks for natural language generation .
evaluation-phase1-master/data-to-text_generation/6/1904.11838v3-Stanza-out.txt	8	9	Moreover , since characters constitute the common " building blocks " of every text , it also allows a more general approach to text generation , enabling the possibility to exploit transfer learning for training .
evaluation-phase1-master/data-to-text_generation/6/1904.11838v3-Stanza-out.txt	23	9	In order to give an original contribution to the field , in this paper we present a character - level sequence - to - sequence model with attention mechanism that results in a completely neural end - to - end architecture .

evaluation-phase1-master/data-to-text_generation/6/1904.11838v3-Stanza-out.txt	25	2	As we will see , such an approach achieves rather interesting performance results and produces a vocabulary - free model that is inherently more general , as it does not depend on a specific domain 's set of terms , but rather on a general alphabet .
evaluation-phase1-master/data-to-text_generation/6/1904.11838v3-Stanza-out.txt	27	9	More specifically , our model shows two important features , with respect to the state - of - art architecture proposed by : ( i ) a character - wise copy mechanism , consisting in a soft switch between generation and copy mode , that disengages the model to learn rare and unhelpful self - correspondences , and ( ii ) a peculiar training procedure , which improves the internal representation capabilities , enhancing recall ; it consists in the exchange of encoder and decoder RNNs , ( GRUs As a further original contribution , we also introduce a new dataset , described in section 3.1 , whose particular structure allows to better highlight improvements in copying / recalling abilities with respect to character - based state - of - art approaches .

evaluation-phase1-master/data-to-text_generation/6/1904.11838v3-Stanza-out.txt	140	11	A more surprising result is that the approach EDA_CS TL allows to obtain better performance with respect to training EDA_CS in the standard way on the Hotel and Restaurant datasets ( for the majority of metrics ) ; on E2E , EDA_CS TL outperforms EDA_CS only in one case ( i.e. meteor metric ) .

evaluation-phase1-master/face_detection/20/1407.4023v2-Stanza-out.txt	11	10	Human face detection have long been one of the most fundamental problems in computer vision and humancomputer interaction .
evaluation-phase1-master/face_detection/20/1407.4023v2-Stanza-out.txt	25	9	In this paper , we adopt a variant of channel features called aggregate channel features , which are extracted directly as pixel values on subsampled channels .

evaluation-phase1-master/face_detection/3/1408.1656v3-Stanza-out.txt	38	9	Secondly , we propose a deep quadratic tree learning method and construct a single soft - cascade AdaBoost classifier to handle complex face manifolds and arbitrary pose and occlusion conditions .
evaluation-phase1-master/face_detection/3/1408.1656v3-Stanza-out.txt	40	9	In this way , different types of faces can be automatically divided into different leaves of a tree classifier , and the complex face manifold in a high dimensional space can be partitioned in the learning process .
evaluation-phase1-master/face_detection/3/1408.1656v3-Stanza-out.txt	41	9	This is the " divide and conquer " strategy to tackle unconstrained face detection in a single classifier , without pre-labeling of views in the training set of face images .

evaluation-phase1-master/face_detection/3/1408.1656v3-Stanza-out.txt	233	8	We set the maximum depth of the tree classifiers to be learned as eight , so that at most eight NPD features need to be evaluated for each tree classifier .
evaluation-phase1-master/face_detection/3/1408.1656v3-Stanza-out.txt	234	8	In the soft cascade training , we set the threshold of each exit as the minimal score of positive samples , i.e. we did not reject positive samples during training .

evaluation-phase1-master/constituency_parsing/0/1602.07776v4-Stanza-out.txt	12	9	In this paper , we introduce recurrent neural network grammars ( RNNGs ; 2 ) , a new generative probabilistic model of sentences that explicitly models nested , hierarchical relationships among words and phrases .
evaluation-phase1-master/constituency_parsing/0/1602.07776v4-Stanza-out.txt	13	9	RNNGs operate via a recursive syntactic process reminiscent of probabilistic context - free grammar generation , but decisions are parameterized using RNNs that condition on the entire syntactic derivation history , greatly relaxing context - free independence assumptions .
evaluation-phase1-master/constituency_parsing/0/1602.07776v4-Stanza-out.txt	15	9	We give two variants of the algorithm , one for parsing ( given an observed sentence , transform it into a tree ) , and one for generation .
evaluation-phase1-master/constituency_parsing/0/1602.07776v4-Stanza-out.txt	24	9	The discriminative model also lets us use ancestor sampling to obtain samples of parse trees for sentences , and this is used to solve a second practical challenge with RNNGs : approximating the marginal likelihood and MAP tree of a sentence under the generative model .

evaluation-phase1-master/constituency_parsing/3/1412.7449v3-Stanza-out.txt	21	9	We found this model to work poorly when we trained it on standard human - annotated parsing datasets ( 1M tokens ) , so we constructed an artificial dataset by labelling a large corpus with the BerkeleyParser .

evaluation-phase1-master/constituency_parsing/3/1412.7449v3-Stanza-out.txt	120	11	An ensemble of 5 LSTM+ A models further improves this score to 92.8 .
evaluation-phase1-master/constituency_parsing/3/1412.7449v3-Stanza-out.txt	122	7	The LSTM + A model trained on WSJ dataset only produced malformed trees for 25 of the 1700 sentences in our development set ( 1.5 % of all cases ) , and the model trained on full high - confidence dataset did this for 14 sentences ( 0.8 % ) .

evaluation-phase1-master/constituency_parsing/7/1611.05774v2-Stanza-out.txt	22	1	We begin with an ablation study to discover the importance of the composition function in 3 .
evaluation-phase1-master/constituency_parsing/7/1611.05774v2-Stanza-out.txt	23	9	Based on the findings , we augment the RNNG composition function with a novel gated attention mechanism ( leading to the GA - RNNG ) to incorporate more interpretability into the model in 4 .
evaluation-phase1-master/constituency_parsing/7/1611.05774v2-Stanza-out.txt	24	2	Using the GA - RNNG , we proceed by investigating the role that individual heads play in phrasal representation ( 5 ) and the role that nonterminal category labels play ( 6 ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/constituency_parsing/7/1611.05774v2-Stanza-out.txt	88	11	The RNNG with only a stack is the strongest of the ablations , and it even outperforms the " full " RNNG with all three data structures .
evaluation-phase1-master/constituency_parsing/7/1611.05774v2-Stanza-out.txt	89	11	Ablating the stack gives the worst among the new results .
evaluation-phase1-master/constituency_parsing/7/1611.05774v2-Stanza-out.txt	93	1	A similar performance degradation is seen in language modeling : the stack - only RNNG achieves the best performance , and ablating the stack is most harmful .
evaluation-phase1-master/constituency_parsing/7/1611.05774v2-Stanza-out.txt	94	11	Indeed , modeling syntax without explicit composition ( the stackablated RNNG ) provides little benefit over a sequential LSTM language model .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/10/N18-1202-Stanza-out.txt	19	9	Using intrinsic evaluations , we show that the higher - level LSTM states capture context - dependent aspects of word meaning ( e.g. , they can be used without modification to perform well on supervised word sense disambiguation tasks ) while lowerlevel states model aspects of syntax ( e.g. , they can be used to do part - of - speech tagging ) .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/14/1801.01900v1-Stanza-out.txt	4	10	Disambiguation is an open problem in Natural Language Processing which is particularly challenging and useful in the unsupervised setting where all the words in any given text need to be disambiguated without using any labeled data .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/14/1801.01900v1-Stanza-out.txt	5	9	Typically WSD systems use the sentence or a small window of words around the target word as the context for disambiguation because their computational complexity scales exponentially with the size of the context .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/14/1801.01900v1-Stanza-out.txt	12	10	Word Sense Disambiguation ( WSD ) is the task of mapping an ambiguous word in a given context to its correct meaning .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/14/1801.01900v1-Stanza-out.txt	22	9	In this paper , we propose a novel knowledge - based WSD algorithm for the all - word WSD task , which utilizes the whole document as the context for a word , rather than just the current sentence used by most WSD systems .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/14/1801.01900v1-Stanza-out.txt	23	9	In order to model the whole document for WSD , we leverage the formalism of topic models , especially Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/14/1801.01900v1-Stanza-out.txt	24	2	Our method is a variant of LDA in which the topic proportions for a document are replaced by synset proportions for a document .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/14/1801.01900v1-Stanza-out.txt	25	9	We use a non-uniform prior for the synset distribution over words to model the frequency of words within a synset .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/14/1801.01900v1-Stanza-out.txt	26	9	Furthermore , we also model the relationships between synsets by using a logisticnormal prior for drawing the synset proportions of the document .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/14/1801.01900v1-Stanza-out.txt	169	11	The proposed method , denoted by WSD - TM in the tables referring to WSD using topic models , outperforms the state - of - the - art WSD system by a significant margin ( pvalue < 0.01 ) by achieving an overall F1 - score of 66.9 as compared to Moro14 's score of 65.5 .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/14/1801.01900v1-Stanza-out.txt	170	11	We also observe that the performance of the proposed model is not much worse than the best supervised system , Melamud16 ( 69.4 ) .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/13/1606.03568v2-Stanza-out.txt	19	10	Improved WSD would be beneficial to many natural language processing ( NLP ) problems , e.g. machine translation , information Retrieval , information Extraction , and sense aware word representations .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/13/1606.03568v2-Stanza-out.txt	23	9	We aim to mitigate these problems by ( 1 ) modeling the sequence of words surrounding the target word , and ( 2 ) refrain from using any hand crafted features or external resources and instead represent the words using real valued vector representation , i.e. word embeddings .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/13/1606.03568v2-Stanza-out.txt	83	6	The source code , implemented using TensorFlow , has been released as open source 1 .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/13/1606.03568v2-Stanza-out.txt	87	8	The embeddings are initialized using a set of freely available 2 Glo Ve vectors trained on Wikipedia and Gigaword .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/13/1606.03568v2-Stanza-out.txt	88	8	Words not included in this set are initialized from N ( 0 , 0.1 ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/13/1606.03568v2-Stanza-out.txt	106	11	Our proposed model achieves the top score on SE2 and are tied with IMS + adapted CW on SE3 .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/13/1606.03568v2-Stanza-out.txt	107	11	Moreover , we see that dropword consistently improves the results on both SE2 and SE3 .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/13/1606.03568v2-Stanza-out.txt	108	1	Randomizing the order of the input words yields a substantially worse result , which provides evidence for our hypothesis that the order of the words are significant .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/13/1606.03568v2-Stanza-out.txt	109	1	We also see that the system effectively makes use of the information in the pre-trained word embeddings and that they are essential to the performance of our system on these datasets .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/11/1905.05677v3-Stanza-out.txt	5	9	We propose two different methods that greatly reduce the size of neural WSD models , with the benefit of improving their coverage without additional training data , and without impacting their precision .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/11/1905.05677v3-Stanza-out.txt	6	9	In addition to our methods , we present a WSD system which relies on pre-trained BERT word vectors in order to achieve results that significantly outperforms the state of the art on all WSD evaluation tasks .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/11/1905.05677v3-Stanza-out.txt	8	10	Word Sense Disambiguation ( WSD ) is a task which aims to clarify a text by assigning to each of its words the most suitable sense labels , given a predefined sense inventory .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/11/1905.05677v3-Stanza-out.txt	17	9	In this work , the idea is to solve this issue by taking advantage of the semantic relationships between senses included in WordNet , such as the hypernymy , the hyponymy , the meronymy , the antonymy , etc .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/11/1905.05677v3-Stanza-out.txt	18	2	Our method is based on the observation that a sense and its closest related senses ( it s hypernym or it s hyponyms for instance ) all share a common idea or concept , and so a word can sometimes be disambiguated using only related concepts .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/11/1905.05677v3-Stanza-out.txt	132	6	For BERT , we used the model named " bert - largecased " of the PyTorch implementation 3 , which consists of vectors of dimension 1024 , trained on Book s Corpus and English Wikipedia .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/11/1905.05677v3-Stanza-out.txt	134	6	For the Transformer encoder layers , we used the same parameters as the " base " model of , that is 6 layers with 8 attention heads , a hidden size of 2048 , and a dropout of 0.1 .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/11/1905.05677v3-Stanza-out.txt	164	11	In the results in , we first observe that our systems that use the sense vocabulary compression through hypernyms or through all relations obtain scores that are overall equivalent to the systems that do not use it .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/11/1905.05677v3-Stanza-out.txt	169	11	In comparison to the other works , thanks to the Princeton WordNet Gloss Corpus added to the training data and the use of BERT as input embeddings , we outperform systematically the state of the art on every task .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/11/1905.05677v3-Stanza-out.txt	180	1	As we can see in , the additional training corpus ( WNGC ) and even more the use of BERT as input embeddings both have a major impact on our results and lead to scores above the state of the art .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/11/1905.05677v3-Stanza-out.txt	181	7	Using BERT instead of ELMo or Glo Ve improves respectively the score by approximately 3 and 5 points in every experiment , and adding the WNGC to the training data improves it by approximately 2 points .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/11/1905.05677v3-Stanza-out.txt	182	1	Finally , using ensembles adds roughly another 1 point to the final F1 score .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/11/1905.05677v3-Stanza-out.txt	186	7	However , the compression method through all relations seems to negatively impact the results in some cases ( when using ELMo or GloVe especially ) .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/9/1601.01343v4-Stanza-out.txt	4	10	Named Entity Disambiguation ( NED ) refers to the task of resolving multiple named entity mentions in a document to their correct references in a knowledge base ( KB ) ( e.g. , Wikipedia ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/9/1601.01343v4-Stanza-out.txt	5	9	In this paper , we propose a novel embedding method specifically designed for NED .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/9/1601.01343v4-Stanza-out.txt	21	9	In this paper , we propose a method to construct a novel embedding that jointly maps words and entities into the same continuous vector space .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/9/1601.01343v4-Stanza-out.txt	22	9	In this model , similar words and entities are placed close to one another in a vector space .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/9/1601.01343v4-Stanza-out.txt	23	9	Hence , we can measure the similarity between any pair of items ( i.e. , words , entities , and a word and an entity ) by simply computing their cosine similarity .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/9/1601.01343v4-Stanza-out.txt	25	9	Our model is based on the skip - gram model , a recently proposed embedding model that learns to predict each context word given the target word .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/9/1601.01343v4-Stanza-out.txt	26	7	Our model consists of the following three models based on the skip - gram model :
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/9/1601.01343v4-Stanza-out.txt	27	9	1 ) the conventional skip - gram model that learns to predict neighboring words given the target word in text corpora , 2 ) the KB graph model that learns to estimate neighboring entities given the target entity in the link graph of the KB , and 3 ) the anchor context model that learns to predict neighboring words given the target entity using anchors and their context words in the KB .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/9/1601.01343v4-Stanza-out.txt	29	9	Based on our proposed embedding , we also develop a straightforward NED method that computes two contexts using the proposed embedding : textual context similarity , and coherence .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/9/1601.01343v4-Stanza-out.txt	32	9	Our NED method combines these contexts with several standard features ( e.g. , prior probability ) using supervised machine learning .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/9/1601.01343v4-Stanza-out.txt	215	11	Our method successfully achieved enhanced performance on both the CoNLL and the TAC 2010 datasets .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/4/1705.02494v3-Stanza-out.txt	27	9	For every text in the KB , our model aims to predict its relevant entities , and places the text and the relevant entities close to each other in a continuous vector space .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/4/1705.02494v3-Stanza-out.txt	28	5	We use humanedited entity annotations obtained from Wikipedia ( see ) as supervised data of relevant entities to the texts containing these annotations .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/4/1705.02494v3-Stanza-out.txt	29	10	Note that , KB entities have been conventionally used to model semantics of texts .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/4/1705.02494v3-Stanza-out.txt	30	10	A representative example is Explicit Semantic Analysis ( ESA ) , which represents the semantics of a text using a sparse vector space , where each dimension corresponds to the relevance score of the text to each entity .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/4/1705.02494v3-Stanza-out.txt	31	10	Essentially , ESA shows that text can be accurately represented using a small set of its relevant entities .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/4/1705.02494v3-Stanza-out.txt	35	11	Furthermore , we also consider that placing texts and entities into the same vector space enables us to easily compute the similarity between texts and entities , which can be beneficial for various KB - related tasks .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/4/1705.02494v3-Stanza-out.txt	137	7	In particular , despite the simplicity of the neural network architecture of our method compared to the state - of - the - art methods ( i.e. , QANTA and FTS - BRNN ) , our method clearly outperformed these methods .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/4/1705.02494v3-Stanza-out.txt	140	11	Our observations indicated that our method mostly performed perfect in terms of predicting the types of target answers ( e.g. , locations , events , and people ) .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/8/2001.03765v1-Stanza-out.txt	22	10	We apply RELIC to entity typing ( mapping each entity to its properties in an external , curated , ontology ) ; entity linking ( identifying which entity is referred to by a textual context ) , and trivia question answering ( retrieving the entity that best answers a question ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/8/2001.03765v1-Stanza-out.txt	98	6	To train RELIC , we obtain data from the 2018 - 10 - 22 dump of English Wikipedia .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/8/2001.03765v1-Stanza-out.txt	154	1	It is clear that masking mentions during training is beneficial for entity typing tasks , but detrimental for entity linking .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/8/2001.03765v1-Stanza-out.txt	159	1	A higher mask rate leads to better performance , both in low and high - data situations .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/15/1804.08460v1-Stanza-out.txt	31	9	A token - level component extracts higher - level features from the whole question context , whereas a character - level component builds lower - level features for the candidate n-gram .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/15/1804.08460v1-Stanza-out.txt	32	9	Simultaneously , we extract features from the knowledge base context of the candidate entity : character - level features are extracted for the entity label and higher - level features are produced based on the entities surrounding the candidate entity in the knowledge graph .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/15/1804.08460v1-Stanza-out.txt	33	9	This information is aggregated and used to predict whether the n-gram is an entity mention and to what entity it should be linked .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/16/1802.09059v1-Stanza-out.txt	16	9	In this effort , we develop our supervised WSD model that leverages a Bidirectional Long Short - Term Memory ( BLSTM ) network .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/16/1802.09059v1-Stanza-out.txt	17	9	This network works with neural sense vectors ( i.e. sense embeddings ) , which are learned during model training , and employs neural word vectors ( i.e. word embeddings ) , which are learned through an unsupervised deep learning approach called GloVe ( Global Vectors for word representation ) for the context words .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/3/1909.10430v2-Stanza-out.txt	7	9	Since vectors of the same word type can vary depending on the respective context , they implicitly provide a model for word sense disambiguation ( WSD ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/3/1909.10430v2-Stanza-out.txt	8	2	We introduce a simple but effective approach to WSD using a nearest neighbor classification on CWEs .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/3/1909.10430v2-Stanza-out.txt	49	9	We show that CWEs can be utilized directly to approach the WSD task due to their nature of providing distinct vector representations for the same token depending on its context .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/3/1909.10430v2-Stanza-out.txt	50	2	To learn the semantic capabilities of CWEs , we employ a simple , yet interpretable approach to WSD using a k -nearest neighbor classification ( kNN ) approach .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/3/1909.10430v2-Stanza-out.txt	139	11	However , we observe a major performance drop of our approach for the two all - words WSD tasks in which no training data is provided along with the test set .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/3/1909.10430v2-Stanza-out.txt	141	10	In fact , similarity of contextualized embeddings largely relies on semantically and structurally similar sentence contexts of polysemic target words .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/3/1909.10430v2-Stanza-out.txt	146	11	As can be seen in , the SE - 2 and SE - 3 training datasets provide more CWEs for each word and sense , and our approach performs better with a growing number of CWEs , even with a higher average number of senses per word as is the casein SE - 3 .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/2/D17-1120-Stanza-out.txt	9	10	As one of the long - standing challenges in Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) , Word Sense Disambiguation , WSD ) has received considerable attention over recent years .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/2/D17-1120-Stanza-out.txt	18	2	In this paper our focus is on supervised WSD , but we depart from previous approaches and adopt a different perspective on the task : instead of framing a separate classification problem for each given word , we aim at modeling the joint disambiguation of the target text as a whole in terms of a sequence labeling problem .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/2/D17-1120-Stanza-out.txt	20	9	With this in mind , we design , analyze and compare experimentally various neural architectures of different complexities , ranging from a single bidirectional Long Short - Term Memory to a sequence - tosequence approach .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/2/D17-1120-Stanza-out.txt	21	9	Each architecture reflects a particular way of modeling the disambiguation problem , but they all share some key features that set them apart from previous supervised approaches to WSD : they are trained end - to - end from sense - annotated text to sense labels , and learn a single all - words model from the training data , without fine tuning or explicit engineering of local features .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/2/D17-1120-Stanza-out.txt	144	8	To set a level playing field with comparison systems on English all - words WSD , we followed and , for all our models , we used a layer of word embeddings pre-trained 8 on the English uk WaC corpus as initialization , and kept them fixed during the training process .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/2/D17-1120-Stanza-out.txt	145	7	For all architectures we then employed 2 layers of bidirectional LSTM with 2048 hidden units ( 1024 units per direction ) .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/2/D17-1120-Stanza-out.txt	161	11	11 Overall , both BLSTM and Seq2Seq achieved results that are either state - of - the - art or statistically equivalent ( unpaired t- test , p < 0.05 ) to the best supervised system in each benchmark , performing on par with word experts tuned over explicitly engineered features .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/2/D17-1120-Stanza-out.txt	162	11	Interestingly enough , BLSTM models tended consistently to outperform their Seq2Seq counterparts , suggesting that an encoder - decoder architecture , despite being more powerful , might be suboptimal for WSD .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/2/D17-1120-Stanza-out.txt	179	11	F - score figures show that bilingual and multilingual models , despite being trained only on English data , consistently outperformed the MFS baseline and achieved results that are competitive with the best participating systems in the task .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/2/D17-1120-Stanza-out.txt	180	11	We also note that the overall F- score performance did not change substantially ( and slightly improved ) when moving from bilingual to multilingual models , despite the increase in the number of target languages treated simultaneously .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/5/1811.00960v1-Stanza-out.txt	182	7	In , we can see that this coverage improvement holds true on the evaluation tasks , for both training sets .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/5/1811.00960v1-Stanza-out.txt	185	11	Now if we look at the results in , the difference of scores obtained by our system using the sense vocabulary reduction or not is overall not significant ( regarding the " ALL " column ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/5/1811.00960v1-Stanza-out.txt	186	11	However we can notice a very large gap on the SemEval 2013 task , especially when the SemCor is used alone for training .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/5/1811.00960v1-Stanza-out.txt	190	11	When we add the WordNet Gloss Tagged to the training data however , we obtain systematically state of the art results on all tasks except on SensEval 3 .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/5/1811.00960v1-Stanza-out.txt	191	1	Once again , the sense reduction method does not consistently improves or decreases the score on every task , and in overall ( task " ALL " ) , the result is roughly the same as without sense reduction applied .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/5/1811.00960v1-Stanza-out.txt	193	11	As we can see , ensembling is a very efficient method in WSD as it improves systematically all our results .

evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/7/1603.07012v2-Stanza-out.txt	20	9	In this paper , we describe two novel WSD algorithms .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/7/1603.07012v2-Stanza-out.txt	21	9	The first is based on a Long Short Term Memory ( LSTM ) ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/entity_linking/7/1603.07012v2-Stanza-out.txt	22	11	Since this model is able to take into account word order when classifying , it performs significantly better than an algorithm based on a continuous bag of words model ( Word2 vec ) , especially on verbs .

evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/5/1506.06158v1-Stanza-out.txt	4	10	We present structured perceptron training for neural network transition - based dependency parsing .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/5/1506.06158v1-Stanza-out.txt	11	10	Lately , dependency parsing has emerged as a popular approach to this problem due to the availability of dependency treebanks in many languages and the efficiency of dependency parsers .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/5/1506.06158v1-Stanza-out.txt	13	10	In transition - based parsing , sentences are processed in a linear left to right pass ; at each position , the parser needs to choose from a set of possible actions defined by the transition strategy .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/5/1506.06158v1-Stanza-out.txt	24	9	In this work , we combine the representational power of neural networks with the superior search enabled by structured training and inference , making our parser one of the most accurate dependency parsers to date .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/5/1506.06158v1-Stanza-out.txt	29	9	As in prior work , we train the neural network to model the probability of individual parse actions .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/5/1506.06158v1-Stanza-out.txt	31	9	Instead , we use the activations from all layers of the neural network as the representation in a structured perceptron model that is trained with beam search and early updates ( Section 3 ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/5/1506.06158v1-Stanza-out.txt	35	2	To this end , we generate large quantities of high - confidence parse trees by parsing unlabeled data with two different parsers and selecting only the sentences for which the two parsers produced the same trees ( Section 3.3 ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/5/1506.06158v1-Stanza-out.txt	36	2	This approach is known as " tri-training " and we show that it benefits our neural network parser significantly more than other approaches .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/5/1506.06158v1-Stanza-out.txt	200	6	We used the publicly available word2vec 2 tool to learn CBOW embeddings following the sample configuration provided with the tool .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/5/1506.06158v1-Stanza-out.txt	219	11	Results
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/5/1506.06158v1-Stanza-out.txt	222	11	The highest of these is , with a reported accuracy of 94.22 % UAS .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/5/1506.06158v1-Stanza-out.txt	223	11	Even though the UAS is not directly comparable , it is typically similar , and this suggests that our model is competitive with some of the highest reported accuries for dependencies on WSJ .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/7/1603.03793v2-Stanza-out.txt	5	11	This form of training , which accounts for model predictions at training time , improves parsing accuracies .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/7/1603.03793v2-Stanza-out.txt	8	10	Natural language parsing can be formulated as a series of decisions that read words in sequence and incrementally combine them to form syntactic structures ; this formalization is known as transitionbased parsing , and is often coupled with a greedy search procedure .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/7/1603.03793v2-Stanza-out.txt	9	10	The literature on transition - based parsing is vast , but all works share in common a classification component that takes into account features of the current parser state 1 and predicts the next action to take conditioned on the state .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/7/1603.03793v2-Stanza-out.txt	17	2	In this work , we adapt the training criterion so as to explore parser states drawn not only from the training data , but also from the model as it is being learned .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/7/1603.03793v2-Stanza-out.txt	18	9	To do so , we use the method of to dynamically chose an optimal ( relative to the final attachment accuracy ) action given an imperfect history .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/7/1603.03793v2-Stanza-out.txt	19	9	By interpolating between algorithm states sampled from the model and those sampled from the training data , more robust predictions at test time can be made .

evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/7/1603.03793v2-Stanza-out.txt	78	11	The score achieved by the dynamic oracle for English is 93.56 UAS .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/7/1603.03793v2-Stanza-out.txt	80	7	Moreover , the Chinese score establishes the state - of - the - art , using the same settings as Chen and Manning ( 2014 ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/1/1603.04351v3-Stanza-out.txt	2	10	Simple and Accurate Dependency Parsing Using Bidirectional LSTM Feature Representations
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/1/1603.04351v3-Stanza-out.txt	24	9	Our proposal ( Section 3 ) is centered around BiRNNs , and more specifically BiLSTMs , which are strong and trainable sequence models ( see Section 2.3 ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/1/1603.04351v3-Stanza-out.txt	26	9	We represent each word by its BiLSTM encoding , and use a concatenation of a minimal set of such BiLSTM encodings as our feature function , which is then passed to a non-linear scoring function ( multi - layer perceptron ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/1/1603.04351v3-Stanza-out.txt	27	9	Crucially , the BiLSTM is trained with the rest of the parser in order to learn a good feature representation for the parsing problem .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/1/1603.04351v3-Stanza-out.txt	29	9	We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by using the BiLSTM feature extractor in two parsing architectures , transition - based ( Section 4 ) as well as a graph - based ( Section 5 ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/1/1603.04351v3-Stanza-out.txt	30	2	In the graphbased parser , we jointly train a structured - prediction model on top of a BiLSTM , propagating errors from the structured objective all the way back to the BiLSTM feature - encoder .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/1/1603.04351v3-Stanza-out.txt	281	6	The parsers are implemented in python , using the PyCNN toolkit 11 for neural network training .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/1/1603.04351v3-Stanza-out.txt	282	4	The code is available at the github repository https://github.com/elikip / bist -parser .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/1/1603.04351v3-Stanza-out.txt	283	6	We use the LSTM variant implemented in PyCNN , and optimize using the Adam optimizer .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/1/1603.04351v3-Stanza-out.txt	299	11	It is clear that our parsers are very competitive , despite using very simple parsing architectures and minimal feature extractors .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/1/1603.04351v3-Stanza-out.txt	300	11	When not using external embeddings , the first - order graph - based parser with 2 features outperforms all other systems thatare not using external resources , including the third - order TurboParser .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/1/1603.04351v3-Stanza-out.txt	301	11	The greedy transition based parser with 4 features also matches or outperforms most other parsers , including the beam - based transition parser with heavily engineered features of and the Stack - LSTM parser of , as well as the same parser when trained using a dynamic oracle .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/1/1603.04351v3-Stanza-out.txt	302	11	Moving from the simple ( 4 features ) to the extended ( 11 features ) feature set leads to some gains in accuracy for both English and Chinese .
evaluation-phase1-master/dependency_parsing/1/1603.04351v3-Stanza-out.txt	303	1	Interestingly , when adding external word embeddings the accuracy of the graph - based parser degrades .

evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/6/S18-1150-Stanza-out.txt	32	2	To tackle this task , we propose an approach that combines a path - based technique and distributional technique via concatenating two feature vectors : a feature vector constructed using dependency parser output and a feature vector obtained using term embeddings .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/6/S18-1150-Stanza-out.txt	33	9	Then , by using the concatenated vector we create a binary supervised classifier model based on support vector machine ( SVM ) algorithm .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/6/S18-1150-Stanza-out.txt	34	9	The model predicts if a term and its candidate hypernym are hypernym related or not .

evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/6/S18-1150-Stanza-out.txt	102	11	In addition , the result shows that our system performs well in discovering new hypernyms not defined in the gold hypernyms where it yields good False Positive values in the three corpora and we achieve the best False Positive value in Medical corpus The evaluation results of our system and other supervised systems .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/6/S18-1150-Stanza-out.txt	114	7	As shown in the table 2 , the candidate hypernym extraction ( CHE ) coverage for English testing terms is 950 ( 63 % ) , that means our system is unable to extract any candidate hypernym for 550 ( 37 % ) terms ( 398 entities and 152 concepts ) .

evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/4/S18-1148-Stanza-out.txt	96	11	This projection learning method performs not very well on task9 , we think the most probable reason is that in , the problem is formalized as a classification problem , in which the ( hyponym , hypernym ) pairs are given .

evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/4/S18-1148-Stanza-out.txt	102	11	The performance evaluated using either cross validation or the test data is much worse than that of a typical hypernym prediction task reported by .

evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/0/S18-1151-Stanza-out.txt	25	10	Even though unsupervised systems tend to rank behind supervised systems in NLP tasks in general , our motivation to focus on an unsupervised approach is derived from the fact that they do not require explicit hand - annotated data , and from the expectation that they are able to generalise more easily to unseen hypernym - hyponym pairs .

evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/3/D16-1041-Stanza-out.txt	18	10	In addition , while not being taxonomy learning systems per se , semi-supervised systems for Information Extraction such as NELL rely crucially on taxonomized concepts and their relations within their learning process .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/3/D16-1041-Stanza-out.txt	25	9	In this paper we propose TAXOEMBED 2 , a hypernym detection algorithm based on sense embeddings , which can be easily applied to the construction of lexical taxonomies .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/3/D16-1041-Stanza-out.txt	26	9	It is designed to discover hypernymic relations by exploiting linear transformations in embedding spaces and , unlike previous approaches , leverages this intuition to learn a specific semanticallyaware transformation matrix for each domain of knowledge .

evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/3/D16-1041-Stanza-out.txt	29	2	Since our method uses a very large semantic network as reference sense inventory , we are able to perform jointly hypernym extraction and dis ambiguation , from which 1 The terminology is not entirely unified in this respect .

evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/3/D16-1041-Stanza-out.txt	140	11	However , TAXOEM - BED , based solely on distributional information , performed competitively in detecting new hypernyms when compared to DefIE , improving its recall in most domains , and even surpassing Yago in technical areas like biology or health .

evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/2/1612.04460v2-Stanza-out.txt	21	2	In this paper we perform an extensive evaluation of various unsupervised distributional measures for hypernymy detection , using several distributional semantic models that differ by context type and feature weighting .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/2/1612.04460v2-Stanza-out.txt	24	9	We analyze the performance of the measures in different settings and suggest a principled way to select the suitable measure , context type and feature weighting according to the task setting , yielding consistent performance across datasets .

evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/2/1612.04460v2-Stanza-out.txt	131	11	The results show preference to the syntactic context - types ( dep and joint ) , which might be explained by the fact that these contexts are richer ( as they contain both proximity and syntactic information ) and therefore more discriminative .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/2/1612.04460v2-Stanza-out.txt	132	7	In feature weighting there is no consistency , but interestingly , raw frequency appears to be successful in hypernymy detection , contrary to previously reported results for word similarity tasks , where PPMI was shown to outperform it .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/2/1612.04460v2-Stanza-out.txt	133	11	The new SLQS variants are on top of the list in many settings .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/2/1612.04460v2-Stanza-out.txt	134	11	In particular they perform well in discriminating hypernyms from symmetric relations ( antonymy , synonymy , coordination ) .

evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/2/1612.04460v2-Stanza-out.txt	192	11	As expected , the unsupervised measures perform worse than the embedding - based classifiers , though generally not bad on their own .

evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/5/S18-1116-Stanza-out.txt	135	11	As shown in , the scores obtained using this system are much higher than the strongest baselines for this task .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/5/S18-1116-Stanza-out.txt	136	11	Furthermore , it is likely that we could improve our scores on 2A and 2B , since we only tuned the system on 1A .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/5/S18-1116-Stanza-out.txt	137	1	If we compare runs 1 and 2 of our hybrid system , we see that data augmentation improved our scores slightly on 1A and 2B , and increased them by several points on 2A .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/5/S18-1116-Stanza-out.txt	138	11	Our cross-evaluation results are better than the supervised baseline computed using the normal evaluation setup , so training our system on general - purpose data produced better results on a domain - specific test set than a strong , supervised baseline trained on the domain - specific data .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/5/S18-1116-Stanza-out.txt	140	11	Note that the unsupervised system outperformed all other unsupervised systems evaluated on this task , and even outperformed the supervised baseline on 2A .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/5/S18-1116-Stanza-out.txt	143	11	Given this observation , we find it somewhat surprising that run 1 is the best on all 3 test sets when we use the hybrid system .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/5/S18-1116-Stanza-out.txt	146	1	To assess the influence of different aspects of the supervised system and its training algorithm , we carried out a few simple ablation tests on subtask 1 A .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/5/S18-1116-Stanza-out.txt	165	1	These results show that 2 of the techniques we used , namely subsampling and multitask learning , actually harmed our system 's performance on test set 1 A , although our experiments on the trial set suggested that they would be beneficial .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/5/S18-1116-Stanza-out.txt	167	1	On the other hand , fine - tuning the word embeddings during training seems to be one of the keys to the success of this approach , as are the use of multiple projection matrices , and the sampling of multiple negative examples for each positive example .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/5/S18-1116-Stanza-out.txt	173	8	We should also note that the supervised model is prone to overfitting , and we found early stopping to be particularly important .

evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	4	10	This paper describes a hypernym discovery system for our participation in the SemEval - 2018 Task 9 , which aims to discover the best ( set of ) candidate hypernyms for input concepts or entities , given the search space of a pre-defined vocabulary .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	14	10	A relevant well - known scenario is hypernym detection , which is a binary task to decide whether a hypernymic relationship holds between a pair of words or not .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	23	9	In this work , we introduce a neural network architecture for the concerned task and empirically study various neural networks to model the distributed representations for words and phrases .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	24	9	In our system , we leverage an unambiguous vector representation via term embedding , and we take advantage of deep neural networks to discover the hypernym relationships between terms .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	83	6	Our model was implemented using the Theano 1 .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	84	8	The diagonal variant of Ada - Grad is used for neural network training .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	85	8	We tune the hyper - parameters with the following range of values : learning rate ?
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	86	6	{ 1 e ? 3 , 1 e ? 2 } , dropout probability ? { 0.1 , 0.2 } , CNN filter width ? { 2 , 3 , 4 }.
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	87	8	The hidden dimension of all neural models are 200 .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	88	8	The batch size is set to 20 and the word embedding and sense embedding sizes are set to 300 .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	89	6	All of our models are trained on a single GPU ( NVIDIA GTX 980 Ti ) , with roughly 1.5h for general - purpose subtask for English and 0.5h domain - specific domain - specific ones for medical and music .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	96	9	Convolution or recurrent gated mechanisms in either CNN - based ( CNN , RCNN ) or RNN ( GRU , LSTM ) based neural networks could essentially be helpful of modeling the semantic connections between words in a phrase , and guide the networks to discover the hypernym relationships .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	97	11	We also observe CNN - based network performance is better than RNN - based , which indicates local features between words could be more important than long - term dependency in this task where the term length is up to trigrams .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	98	2	To investigate the performance of neural models on specific domains , we conduct experiments on medical and medicine subtask .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	100	11	All the neural models outperform term embedding averaging in terms of all the metrics and CNN - based network also performs better than RNN - based ones in most of the metrics using word embedding , which verifies our hypothesis in the general - purpose task .
evaluation-phase1-master/hypernym_discovery/1/S18-1147-Stanza-out.txt	101	11	Compared with word embedding , the sense embedding shows a much poorer result though they work closely in generalpurpose subtask .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	2	10	Learning Word Representations with Cross - Sentence Dependency for End - to - End Co -reference Resolution
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	4	9	In this work , we present a word embedding model that learns cross - sentence dependency for improving end - to - end co-reference resolution ( E2E - CR ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	5	9	While the traditional E2E - CR model generates word representations by running long short - term memory ( LSTM ) recurrent neural networks on each sentence of an input article or conversation separately , we propose linear sentence linking and attentional sentence linking models to learn crosssentence dependency .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	10	10	Co-reference resolution requires models to cluster mentions that refer to the same physical entities .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	24	9	To solve the problem that traditional LSTM encoders , which treat the input sentences as a batch , lack an ability to capture cross - sentence dependency , and to avoid the time complexity and difficulties of training the model concatenating all input sentences , we propose a cross - sentence encoder for end - to - end co-reference ( E2E - CR ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	25	9	Borrowing the idea of an external memory module from , an external memory block containing syntactic and semantic information from context sentences is added to the standard LSTM model .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	26	9	With this context memory block , the proposed model is able to encode input sentences as a batch , and also calculate the representations of input words by taking both target sentences and context sentences into consideration .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	87	7	In practice , the LSTM modules applied in our model have 200 output units .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	88	8	In ASL , we calculate cross - sentence dependency using a multilayer perceptron with one hidden layer consisting of 150 hidden units .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	89	8	The initial learning rate is set as 0.001 and decays 0.001 % every 100 steps .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	90	8	The model is optimized with the Adam algorithm ( Kingma and Ba , 2014 ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	91	8	We randomly select up to 40 continuous sentences for training if the input is too long .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	93	7	Experiment Results and Discussion
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	97	11	Comparing with the baseline model that achieved 67.2 % F1 score , the ASL model improved the performance by 0.6 % and achieved 67.8 % average F1 .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	108	11	show that the models that consider cross - sentence dependency significantly outperform the baseline model , which encodes each sentence from the input document separately .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/6/D18-1518-Stanza-out.txt	109	11	Experiments also indicated that the ASL model has better performance than the LSL model , since it summarizes extracts context information with an attention mechanism instead of simply viewing sentence - level embeddings .

evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/9/1908.09091v4-Stanza-out.txt	87	11	BERT - large , however , improves c 2 f - coref by the much larger margin of 3.9 % .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/9/1908.09091v4-Stanza-out.txt	88	1	We also observe that the overlap variant offers no improvement over independent .

evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/4/1706.02256v2-Stanza-out.txt	15	10	Current research in anaphora ( or coreference ) resolution is focused on resolving noun phrases referring to concrete objects or entities in the real Leo Born , Juri Opitz and Anette Frank contributed equally to this work .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/4/1706.02256v2-Stanza-out.txt	28	9	Our model is inspired by the mention - ranking model for coreference resolution and combines it with a Siamese Net , for learning similarity between sentences .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/4/1706.02256v2-Stanza-out.txt	29	9	Given an anaphoric sentence ( AntecS in ( 1 ) ) and a candidate antecedent ( any constituent in a given context , e.g. being obsoleted by microprocessor - based machines in ( 1 ) ) , the LSTM - Siamese Net learns representations for the candidate and the anaphoric sentence in a shared space .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/4/1706.02256v2-Stanza-out.txt	30	9	These representations are combined into a joint representation used to calculate a score that characterizes the relation between them .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/4/1706.02256v2-Stanza-out.txt	31	9	The learned score is used to select the highest - scoring antecedent candidate for the given anaphoric sentence and hence its anaphor .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/4/1706.02256v2-Stanza-out.txt	32	9	We consider one anaphor at a time and provide the embedding of the context of the anaphor and the embedding of the head of the anaphoric phrase to the input to characterize each individual anaphorsimilar to the encoding proposed by for individuating multiply occurring predicates in SRL .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/4/1706.02256v2-Stanza-out.txt	33	9	With deeper inspection we show that the model learns a relation between the anaphor in the anaphoric sentence and its antecedent .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/4/1706.02256v2-Stanza-out.txt	36	5	It produces large amounts of instances and is easily adaptable to other languages .

evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/4/1706.02256v2-Stanza-out.txt	190	11	From we observe : ( 1 ) with HPs tuned on ARRAU - AA , we obtain results well beyond KZH13 , ( 2 ) all ablated model variants perform worse than the full model , ( 3 ) a large performance drop when omitting syntactic information ( tag , cut ) suggests that the model makes good use of it .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/4/1706.02256v2-Stanza-out.txt	195	11	Performance of 68.10 s@1 score indicates that the model is able to learn without syntactic guidance , contrary to the 19.68 s@1 score before tuning .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/4/1706.02256v2-Stanza-out.txt	199	11	Results on the ARRAU corpus
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/4/1706.02256v2-Stanza-out.txt	200	11	The MR - LSTM is more successful in resolving nominal than pronominal anaphors , although the training data provides only pronominal ones .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/4/1706.02256v2-Stanza-out.txt	202	11	Moreover , for shell noun resolution in KZH13 's dataset , the MR - LSTM achieved s@1 scores in the range 76.09-93.14 , while the best variant of the model achieves 51.89 s@1 score for nominal anaphors in ARRAU - AA .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/4/1706.02256v2-Stanza-out.txt	209	11	This is what we can observe from row 2 vs. row 6 in Table 5 : the MR - LSTM without context embedding ( ctx ) achieves a comparable s@ 2 score with the variant that omits syntactic information , but better s@3 - 4 scores .

evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/8/1707.07045v2-Stanza-out.txt	12	9	We demonstrate for the first time that these resources are not required , and in fact performance can be improved significantly without them , by training an end - to - end neural model that jointly learns which spans are entity mentions and how to best cluster them .

evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/8/1707.07045v2-Stanza-out.txt	155	11	The most significant gains come from improvements in recall , which is likely due to our end - toend setup .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/8/1707.07045v2-Stanza-out.txt	162	1	The distance between spans and the width of spans are crucial signals for coreference resolution , consistent with previous findings from other coreference models .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/8/1707.07045v2-Stanza-out.txt	163	1	They contribute 3.8 F1 to the final result .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/8/1707.07045v2-Stanza-out.txt	169	1	Since coreference decisions often involve rare named entities , we see a contribution of 0.9 F1 from character - level modeling .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/8/1707.07045v2-Stanza-out.txt	173	1	Ablations also show a 1.3 F1 degradation in performance without the attention mechanism for finding task - specific heads .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/8/1707.07045v2-Stanza-out.txt	181	1	As shown in , keeping mention candidates detected by the rule - based system over predicted parse trees ( Raghunathan et al. , 2010 ) degrades performance by 1 F1 .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/8/1707.07045v2-Stanza-out.txt	183	11	With oracle mentions , we see an improvement of 17.5 F1 , suggesting an enormous room for improvement if our model can produce better mention scores and anaphoricity decisions .

evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/0/1606.01323v2-Stanza-out.txt	16	9	In this work , we instead train a deep neural network to build distributed representations of pairs of coreference clusters .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/0/1606.01323v2-Stanza-out.txt	17	9	This captures entity - level information with a large number of learned , continuous features instead of a small number of hand - crafted categorical ones .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/0/1606.01323v2-Stanza-out.txt	18	9	Using the cluster - pair representations , our network learns when combining two coreference clusters is desirable .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/0/1606.01323v2-Stanza-out.txt	19	9	At test time it builds up coreference clusters incrementally , starting with each mention in its own cluster and then merging a pair of clusters each step .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/0/1606.01323v2-Stanza-out.txt	20	9	It makes these decisions with a novel easy - first cluster - ranking procedure that combines the strengths of cluster - ranking ( Rahman and and easy - first coreference algorithms .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/0/1606.01323v2-Stanza-out.txt	22	9	We address this by using a learning - to - search algorithm inspired by SEARN to train our neural network .

evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/3/1804.05392v1-Stanza-out.txt	16	9	At each iteration , the antecedent distribution is used as an attention mechanism to optionally update existing span representations , enabling later corefer - Speaker 1 : U m and think that is what 's - Go ahead Linda .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/3/1804.05392v1-Stanza-out.txt	19	2	To alleviate computational challenges from this higher - order inference , we also propose a coarseto - fine approach that is learned with a single endto - end objective .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/3/1804.05392v1-Stanza-out.txt	20	2	We introduce a less accurate but more efficient coarse factor in the pairwise scoring function .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/3/1804.05392v1-Stanza-out.txt	21	9	This additional factor enables an extra pruning step during inference that reduces the number of antecedents considered by the more accurate but inefficient fine factor .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/3/1804.05392v1-Stanza-out.txt	22	9	Intuitively , the model cheaply computes a rough sketch of likely antecedents before applying a more expensive scoring function .

evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/3/1804.05392v1-Stanza-out.txt	118	11	The baseline relative to our contributions is the span - ranking model from augmented with both ELMo and hyperparameter tuning , which achieves 72.3 F1 .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/3/1804.05392v1-Stanza-out.txt	119	11	Our full approach achieves 73.0 F1 , setting a new state of the art for coreference resolution .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/3/1804.05392v1-Stanza-out.txt	121	11	Despite using far less computation , it outperforms the baseline because the coarse scores s c ( i , j ) can be computed for all antecedents , enabling the model to potentially predict a coreference link between any two spans in the document .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/3/1804.05392v1-Stanza-out.txt	122	11	As a result , we observe a much higher recall when adopting the coarse - to - fine approach .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/3/1804.05392v1-Stanza-out.txt	123	11	We also observe further improvement by including the second - order inference ( Section 3 ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/2/1609.08667v3-Stanza-out.txt	4	9	Coreference resolution systems are typically trained with heuristic loss functions that require careful tuning .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/2/1609.08667v3-Stanza-out.txt	15	9	To address this , we explore using two variants of reinforcement learning to directly optimize a coreference system for coreference evaluation metrics .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/2/1609.08667v3-Stanza-out.txt	16	2	In particular , we modify the max-margin coreference objective proposed by by incorporating the reward associated with each coreference decision into the loss 's slack rescaling .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/2/1609.08667v3-Stanza-out.txt	17	7	We also test the REINFORCE policy gradient algorithm .

evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/2/1609.08667v3-Stanza-out.txt	110	1	We find that REINFORCE does slightly better than the heuristic loss , but reward rescaling performs significantly better than both on both languages .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/2/1609.08667v3-Stanza-out.txt	115	1	The reward - rescaled max - margin loss combines the best of both worlds , resulting in superior performance .

evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/5/1604.03035v1-Stanza-out.txt	4	1	There is compelling evidence that coreference prediction would benefit from modeling global information about entity - clusters .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/5/1604.03035v1-Stanza-out.txt	12	9	In this work , we posit that global context is indeed necessary for further improvements in coreference resolution , but argue that informative cluster , rather than mention , level features are very difficult to devise , limiting their effectiveness .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/5/1604.03035v1-Stanza-out.txt	13	9	Accordingly , we instead propose to learn representations of mention clusters by embedding them sequentially using a recurrent neural network ( shown in Section 4 ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/5/1604.03035v1-Stanza-out.txt	14	9	Our model has no manually defined cluster features , but instead learns a global representation from the individual mentions present in each cluster .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/5/1604.03035v1-Stanza-out.txt	15	9	We incorporate these representations into a mention - ranking style coreference system .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/5/1604.03035v1-Stanza-out.txt	16	9	The entire model , including the recurrent neural network and the mention - ranking sub-system , is trained end - to - end on the coreference task .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/5/1604.03035v1-Stanza-out.txt	17	9	We train the model as a local classifier with fixed context ( that is , as a history - based model ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/5/1604.03035v1-Stanza-out.txt	181	8	For training , we use document - size minibatches , which allows for efficient pre-computation of RNN states , and we minimize the loss described in Section 5 with AdaGrad ( after clipping LSTM gradients to lie ( elementwise ) in ( ?10 , 10 ) ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/5/1604.03035v1-Stanza-out.txt	182	8	We find that the initial learning rate chosen for AdaGrad has a significant impact on results , and we choose learning rates for each layer out of { 0.1 , 0.02 , 0.01 , 0.002 , 0.001 } .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/5/1604.03035v1-Stanza-out.txt	183	8	In experiments , we set ha ( x n ) , h c ( x n ) , and h ( m ) to be ? R 200 , and hp ( x n , y) ? R 700 .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/5/1604.03035v1-Stanza-out.txt	184	6	We use a single - layer LSTM ( without " peep - hole " connections ) , as implemented in the element - rnn library .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/5/1604.03035v1-Stanza-out.txt	185	8	For regularization , we apply Dropout with a rate of 0.4 before applying the linear weights u , and we also apply Dropout with a rate of 0.3 to the LSTM states before forming the dot -product scores .

evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/5/1604.03035v1-Stanza-out.txt	203	11	In we see that the RNN improves performance over all , with the most dramatic improve - ments on non-anaphoric pronouns , though errors are also decreased significantly for non-anaphoric nominal and proper mentions that follow at least one mention with the same head .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/5/1604.03035v1-Stanza-out.txt	205	11	Importantly , the RNN performance is significantly better than that of the Avg baseline , which barely improves over mention - ranking , even with oracle history .

evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/7/P19-1066-Stanza-out.txt	19	2	Our " Entity Equalization " approach posits that each entity should be represented via the sum of its corresponding mention representations .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/7/P19-1066-Stanza-out.txt	22	2	Similar to recent coreference models , our approach uses contextual embeddings as input mention representations .
evaluation-phase1-master/coreference_resolution/7/P19-1066-Stanza-out.txt	23	9	While previous approaches employed the ELMo model , we propose to use BERT embeddings , motivated by the impressive empirical performance of BERT on other tasks .

evaluation-phase1-master/face_alignment/3/1904.07399v2-Stanza-out.txt	15	10	Face alignment , also known as facial landmark localization , seeks to localize pre-defined landmarks on human faces .
evaluation-phase1-master/face_alignment/3/1904.07399v2-Stanza-out.txt	30	9	We thus propose a new loss function and name it Adaptive Wing loss ( Sec. , that is able to significantly improve the quality of heatmap regression results .
evaluation-phase1-master/face_alignment/3/1904.07399v2-Stanza-out.txt	31	1	Due to the translation invariance of the convolution operation in bottom - up and top - down CNN structures such as stacked Hourglass ( HG ) , the network is notable to capture coordinate information , which we believe is useful for facial landmark localization , since the structure of human faces is relatively stable .
evaluation-phase1-master/face_alignment/3/1904.07399v2-Stanza-out.txt	32	9	Inspired by the Coord - Conv layer proposed by Liu et al. , we encode into our model the full coordinate information and the information only on boundaries predicted from the previous HG module into our model .
evaluation-phase1-master/face_alignment/3/1904.07399v2-Stanza-out.txt	34	2	To encode boundary coordinates , we also add a sub-task of boundary prediction by concatenating an additional boundary channel into the ground truth heatmap which is jointly trained with other channels .

evaluation-phase1-master/face_alignment/2/1904.02549v1-Stanza-out.txt	4	10	Face Alignment is an active computer vision domain , that consists in localizing a number of facial landmarks that vary across datasets .
evaluation-phase1-master/face_alignment/2/1904.02549v1-Stanza-out.txt	22	9	In this paper , we introduce a Deep convolutional Cascade for Face Alignment ( DeCaFA ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/face_alignment/2/1904.02549v1-Stanza-out.txt	23	9	DeCaFA is composed of several stages that each produce landmark - wise attention maps , relatively to heterogeneous annotation markups .
evaluation-phase1-master/face_alignment/2/1904.02549v1-Stanza-out.txt	25	9	It illustrates how these attention maps are refined through the successive stages , and how the different prediction tasks can benefit from each other .
evaluation-phase1-master/face_alignment/2/1904.02549v1-Stanza-out.txt	130	7	The DeCaFA models that will be investigated below use 1 to 4 stages that each contains 12 3 3 convolutional layers with 64 ? 64 ? 128 ? 128 ? 256 ? 256 channels for the downsampling portion , and vice - versa for the upsampling portion .

evaluation-phase1-master/face_alignment/2/1904.02549v1-Stanza-out.txt	153	7	The accuracy steadily increases as we add more stages , and saturates after the third on LFPW and HELEN , which is a well - known behavior of cascaded models , showing that DeCaFA with weighted intermediate supervision indeed works as a cascade , by first providing coarse estimates and refining in the later stages .
evaluation-phase1-master/face_alignment/2/1904.02549v1-Stanza-out.txt	156	1	Coarsely annotated data ( 5 landmarks ) significantly helps the fine - grained landmark localization , as it is integrated a kind of weakly supervised scheme .
evaluation-phase1-master/face_alignment/2/1904.02549v1-Stanza-out.txt	160	11	First , reinjecting the whole input image ( F 3 - Equation vs F 2 - Equation ) significantly improves the accuracy on challenging data such as 300 W - challenging or WFLW - pose , where the first cascade stages may commit errors .

evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/23/P16-1098-Stanza-out.txt	14	10	Among many natural language processing ( NLP ) tasks , such as text classification , question answering and machine translation , a common problem is modelling the relevance / similarity of a pair of texts , which is also called text semantic matching .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/23/P16-1098-Stanza-out.txt	25	9	In this paper , we adopt a deep fusion strategy to model the strong interactions of two sentences .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/23/P16-1098-Stanza-out.txt	28	10	Thus , text matching can be regarded as modelling the interaction of two texts in a recursive matching way .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/23/P16-1098-Stanza-out.txt	29	9	Following this idea , we propose deep fusion long short - term memory neural networks ( DF - LSTMs ) to model the interactions recursively .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/23/P16-1098-Stanza-out.txt	30	9	More concretely , DF - LSTMs consist of two interconnected conditional LSTMs , each of which models apiece of text under the influence of another .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/23/P16-1098-Stanza-out.txt	31	2	The output vector of DF - LSTMs is fed into a task - specific output layer to compute the match - ing score .

evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/30/1503.03244v1-Stanza-out.txt	4	10	Semantic matching is of central importance to many natural language tasks [ 2,28 ] .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/30/1503.03244v1-Stanza-out.txt	11	10	Matching two potentially heterogenous language objects is central to many natural language applications .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/30/1503.03244v1-Stanza-out.txt	14	10	Natural language sentences have complicated structures , both sequential and hierarchical , that are essential for understanding them .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/30/1503.03244v1-Stanza-out.txt	15	10	A successful sentence - matching algorithm therefore needs to capture not only the internal structures of sentences but also the rich patterns in their interactions .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/30/1503.03244v1-Stanza-out.txt	16	9	Towards this end , we propose deep neural network models , which adapt the convolutional strategy ( proven successful on image and speech ) to natural language .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/30/1503.03244v1-Stanza-out.txt	17	9	To further explore the relation between representing sentences and matching them , we devise a novel model that can naturally host both the hierarchical composition for sentences and the simple - to - comprehensive fusion of matching patterns with the same convolutional architecture .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/30/1503.03244v1-Stanza-out.txt	18	9	Our model is generic , requiring no prior knowledge of natural language ( e.g. , parse tree ) and putting essentially no constraints on the matching tasks .

evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/10/N18-2015-Stanza-out.txt	27	7	Second , we find that considering only the last sentence of the context outperforms models that consider the full context .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/10/N18-2015-Stanza-out.txt	29	2	In sum , our approach differs from previous efforts in the joint use of three strategies : ( 1 ) using skip - thought embeddings for sentences in the story in a feed - forward neural network , ( 2 ) training the model on the provided validation set , and ( 3 ) considering the two endings with only the last sentence in the prompt .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/10/N18-2015-Stanza-out.txt	83	8	We use cross-entropy loss and SGD with learning rate of 0.01 .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/10/N18-2015-Stanza-out.txt	84	8	During training , we save the model every 3000 iterations , and calculate the validation accuracy .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/10/N18-2015-Stanza-out.txt	89	7	The 3 - layer feed - forward neural network trained on the validation set by summing the skip - thought embeddings of the last sentence ( LS ) of the story prompt and the ending gives the best accuracy ( 76.5 % ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/10/N18-2015-Stanza-out.txt	91	11	Comparing ' val - LS- skip ' to ' val - LS - Glo Ve ' ( i.e. , using skip - thought embeddings for sentences vs. GloVe word embeddings ) , we confirm that the success of this approach lies in the sizable boost to accuracy from the use of pretrained skip - thought embeddings .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/10/N18-2015-Stanza-out.txt	95	11	We note that the model trained using only the last sentence ( LS ) of the story context has higher accuracy compared to the model that uses a GRU to encode the full context ( FC ) , and even the model which encodes the entire context .

evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/14/1503.08895v5-Stanza-out.txt	15	9	Our model can be considered a continuous form of the Memory Network implemented in [ 23 ] .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/14/1503.08895v5-Stanza-out.txt	17	9	The continuity of the model we present here means that it can be trained end - to - end from input - output pairs , and so is applicable to more tasks , i.e. tasks where such supervision is not available , such as in language modeling or realistically supervised question answering tasks .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/14/1503.08895v5-Stanza-out.txt	18	9	Our model can also be seen as a version of RNNsearch [ 2 ] with multiple computational steps ( which we term " hops " ) per output symbol .

evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/29/1710.10504v2-Stanza-out.txt	19	9	Inspired by the above - mentioned works , we are proposing to introduce a general framework PhaseCond for the use of multiple attention layers .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/29/1710.10504v2-Stanza-out.txt	21	2	First , previous research on the self - attention model is to purely capture long - distance dependencies , and therefore a multi-hops architecture is used to alternatively captures question - aware passage representations and refines the results by using a self - attention model .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/29/1710.10504v2-Stanza-out.txt	24	9	Second , unlike the domains such as machine translation which jointly align and translate words , question - passage attention models for machine comprehension and question answering calculate the alignment matrix corresponding to all question and passage word pairs .

evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/29/1710.10504v2-Stanza-out.txt	127	9	Our explanations is that 1 ) RNET uses a different feature set ( e.g. , Glo Ve 300 dimensional word vectors are employed ) and different encoding steps ( e.g. , three GRU layers are used for encoding question and passage representations ) , and 2 ) RNET uses a different ensemble method from our implementation .

evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/13/1606.02270v2-Stanza-out.txt	4	10	We present the EpiReader , a novel model for machine comprehension of text .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/13/1606.02270v2-Stanza-out.txt	5	10	Machine comprehension of unstructured , real - world text is a major research goal for natural language processing .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/13/1606.02270v2-Stanza-out.txt	6	10	Current tests of machine comprehension pose questions whose answers can be inferred from some supporting text , and evaluate a model 's response to the questions .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/13/1606.02270v2-Stanza-out.txt	13	9	We propose a deep , end - to - end , neural comprehension model that we call the EpiReader .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/13/1606.02270v2-Stanza-out.txt	26	9	The EpiReader factors into two components .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/13/1606.02270v2-Stanza-out.txt	27	9	The first component extracts a small set of potential answers based on a shallow comparison of the question with its supporting text ; we call this the Extractor .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/13/1606.02270v2-Stanza-out.txt	28	9	The second component reranks the proposed answers based on deeper semantic comparisons with the text ; we call this the Reasoner .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/13/1606.02270v2-Stanza-out.txt	32	9	The semantic comparisons implemented by the Reasoner are based on the concept of recognizing textual entailment ( RTE ) , also known as natural language inference .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/13/1606.02270v2-Stanza-out.txt	34	9	Thus , the Extractor serves the important function of filtering a large set of potential answers down to a small , tractable set of likely candidates for more thorough testing .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/13/1606.02270v2-Stanza-out.txt	35	9	The Extractor follows the form of a pointer network , and uses a differentiable attention mechanism to indicate words in the text that potentially answer the question .

evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/13/1606.02270v2-Stanza-out.txt	38	9	The Reasoner forms hypotheses by inserting the candidate answers into the question , then estimates the concordance of each hypothesis with each sentence in the supporting text .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/13/1606.02270v2-Stanza-out.txt	39	7	We use these estimates as a measure of the evidence for a hypothesis , and aggregate evidence overall sentences .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/13/1606.02270v2-Stanza-out.txt	40	2	In the end , we combine the Reasoner 's evidence with the Extractor 's probability estimates to produce a final ranking of the answer candidates .

evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/5/1602.07019v2-Stanza-out.txt	4	10	Most conventional sentence similarity methods only focus on similar parts of two input sentences , and simply ignore the dissimilar parts , which usually give us some clues and semantic meanings about the sentences .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/5/1602.07019v2-Stanza-out.txt	45	9	In this paper , we propose a novel model to tackle all these challenges jointly by decomposing and composing lexical semantics over sentences .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/5/1602.07019v2-Stanza-out.txt	46	9	Given a sentence pair , the model represents each word as a low -dimensional vector ( challenge 1 ) , and calculates a semantic matching vector for each word based on all words in the other sentence ( challenge 2 ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/5/1602.07019v2-Stanza-out.txt	47	9	Then based on the semantic matching vector , each word vector is decomposed into two components : a similar component and a dissimilar component ( challenge 3 ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/5/1602.07019v2-Stanza-out.txt	48	9	We use similar components of all the words to represent the similar parts of the sentence pair , and dissimilar components of every word to model the dissimilar parts explicitly .

evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/1/D18-1054-Stanza-out.txt	20	9	The ConZNet architecture consists of two phases .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/1/D18-1054-Stanza-out.txt	21	9	In the first phase we identify the relevant regions of text by employing a reinforcement learning algorithm .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/1/D18-1054-Stanza-out.txt	23	9	The second phase is based on an encoder - decoder architecture , which comprehends the identified regions of text and generates the answer by using a residual self - attention network as encoder and a RNNbased sequence generator along with a pointer network as the decoder .
evaluation-phase1-master/natural_language_inference/1/D18-1054-Stanza-out.txt	27	2	Unlike existing approaches , our method has the ability to select relevant regions of text not just based on the question but also on how well regions are related to each other .

evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/15/1605.07725v3-Stanza-out.txt	20	10	Adversarial perturbations typically consist of making small modifications to very many real - valued inputs .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/15/1605.07725v3-Stanza-out.txt	21	9	For text classification , the input is discrete , and usually represented as a series of highdimensional one - hot vectors .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/15/1605.07725v3-Stanza-out.txt	22	9	Because the set of high - dimensional one - hot vectors does not admit infinitesimal perturbation , we define the perturbation on continuous word embeddings instead of discrete word inputs .

evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/3/1901.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	30	2	In this paper , we investigate modifications on the network proposed by Conneau et al. with the aim of reducing its number of parameters , storage size and latency with minimal performance degradation .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/3/1901.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	31	9	To achieve these improvements we used Temporal Depthwise Separable Convolution and Global Average Pooling techniques .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/3/1901.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	32	9	Therefore , our main contribution is to propose the Squeezed Very Deep Convolutional Neural Networks ( SVDCNN ) , a text classification model which requires significantly fewer parameters compared to the stateof - the - art CNNs .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/3/1901.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	141	6	For SVDCNN and Char - CNN , we calculated the abovementioned number from the network architecture implemented in PyTorch .

evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/3/1901.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	158	11	The network reduction obtained by the GAP is even more representative since both compared models use three FC layers for their classification tasks .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/3/1901.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	159	12	Considering a dataset with four target classes , and comparing SVDCNN with VDCNN , the number of parameters of the FC layers has passed from 12.59 to 0.02 million parameters , representing a reduction of 99.84 % .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/3/1901.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	160	11	Following with the same comparison , but to Char - CNN , the proposed model is 99.82 % smaller , 0.02 against 11.36 million of FC parameters .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/3/1901.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	162	7	While our most in - depth model ( 29 ) occupies only 6 MB , VDCNN with the same depth occupies 64. 16 MB of storage .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/3/1901.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	166	11	Regarding accuracy results , usually , a model with such parameter reduction should present some loss of accuracy in comparison to the original model .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/3/1901.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	167	11	Nevertheless , the performance difference between VDCNN and SVDCNN models varies between 0.4 and 1.3 % , which is pretty modest considering the parameters and storage size reduction aforementioned .

evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/7/1805.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	116	11	The classifiers based on the MultiCCA embeddings perform very well on the development corpus ( accuracies close or exceeding 90 % ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/7/1805.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	117	11	The system trained on English also achieves excellent results when transfered to a different languages , it scores best for three out of seven languages ( DE , IT and ZH ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/7/1805.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	119	11	However , the transfer accuracies are quite low when training the classifiers on other languages than English , in particular for Russian , Chinese and Japanese .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/7/1805.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	120	11	The systems using multilingual sentence embeddings seem to be over all more robust and less language specific .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/7/1805.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	122	11	Training on German or French actually leads to better transfer performance than training on English .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/7/1805.09821v1-Stanza-out.txt	123	11	Crosslingual transfer between very different languages like Chinese and Russian also achieves remarkable results .

evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	5	10	Recent developments in cross - lingual understanding ( XLU ) has made progress in this area , trying to bridge the language barrier using language universal representations .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	8	2	We combine state - of - the - art cross - lingual methods with recently proposed methods for weakly supervised learning such as unsupervised pre-training and unsupervised data augmentation to simultaneously close both the language gap and the domain gap in XLU .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	38	2	In particular , we focus on two approaches for domain adaptation .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	39	2	The first method is based on masked language model ( MLM ) pre-training ( as in ) using unlabeled target language corpora .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	41	2	The second method is unsupervised data augmentation ( UDA ) ) , where synthetic paraphrases are generated from the unlabeled corpus , and the model is trained on a label consistency loss .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	152	3	Fine-tune ( Ft ) : Fine - tuning the pre-trained model with the source - domain training set .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	154	3	Fine - tune with UDA ( UDA ) :
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	155	3	This method utilizes the unlabeled data from the target domain by optimizing the UDA loss function ( Eq. ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	156	3	Self - training based on the UDA model ( UDA + Self ) :
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	157	7	We first train the Ft model and UDA model , and choose the better one as the teacher model .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	158	9	The teacher model is used to train a new XLM student using only unlabeled data U tgt in the target domain , as described above .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	171	11	Looking at Ft ( XLM ) results , it is clear that without the help of unlabeled data from the target domain , there still exists a substantial gap between the model performance of the cross -lingual settings and the monolingual baselines , even when using state - of - the - art pre-trained cross -lingual representations .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	172	1	Both the UDA algorithm and MLM pre-training can offer significant improvements by utilizing the unlabeled data .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	173	11	In the sentiment classification task , where the unlabeled data size is larger , Ft ( XLM ft ) model usnig MLM pre-training consistently provides larger improvements compared with the UDA method .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	174	11	On the other hand , the MLM method is relatively more resource intensive and takes longer to converge ( see Appendix A.5 ) .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	175	1	In contrast , in the MLdoc dataset , when the size of the unlabeled samples is limited , the UDA method is more helpful .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	178	11	In the sentiment classification task , we observe the self - training technique consistently improves over its teacher model .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	179	11	It offers best results in both XLM and XLM ft based classifiers .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	181	7	In the MLdoc dataset , self - training also achieves the best results over all , however the gains are less clear .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	183	1	Finally , comparing with the best cross - lingual results and monolingual fine - tune baseline , we are able to completely close the performance gap by utilizing unlabeled data in the target language .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	184	11	Furthermore , our framework reaches new state - of - the - art results , improving over vanilla XLM baselines by 44 % on average .
evaluation-phase1-master/document_classification/1/1909.07009v2-Stanza-out.txt	214	11	Leveraging the unlabeled data from other domains does not offer consistent improvement , however can provide additional value in isolated cases .
